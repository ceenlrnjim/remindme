Personal reminder application

clojure based dsl and background agent

Notes and concepts:
Start an agent with a file for the configuration location (serialized clojure data structures)
cli updates the file
agent polls the file, checks for events, and reacts accordingly
probably need some kind of audit file of actions taken as well
